Customer segmentation and cohort analysis of real retail data using brute force, heuristic, and algorithmic approaches.

I extracted and cleaned 525k records from an UK eCommerce store and had dynamic currency conversion. Customers were segmented into monthly cohorts, RFM quartiles, and k-means clusters. K-means was iterated further and optimized. I mainly used Seaborn for visualizations to analyze and compare the different appraoches and their resulting segments based on customer purchasing behaviour and metrics (i.e. CLV), and found k-means clustering produced the optimal results.
